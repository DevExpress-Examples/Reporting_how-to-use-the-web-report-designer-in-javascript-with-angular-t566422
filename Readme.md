This example demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103/Concepts/End-User-Reporting/ASP-NET/End-User-Report-Designer-for-ASP-NET">End-User Web Report Designer</a>  in JavaScript with <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>.<br><br>The example consists of two parts: <br>1. A server (backend) project in the ASP.NET MVC implementation, where cross-domain requests are enabled (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and custom report storage is implemented.<br>2. An Angular client application (frontend) that includes necessary styles, scripts, and HTML-templates. <br><br>To download all the required client resources for deploying the control, navigate to the client part's root folder, open the console, and run the following command:<br><em>npm install<br><br></em>
<p>To enable the example proper operation, first run the backend project in Visual Studio and then run the client part using the command below:</p>
<em>npm start<br><br></em>Open your browser on <em><a href="http://localhost:4200/">http://localhost:4200/</a></em> to see the result.<em><br><br></em>For a step-by-step tutorial, refer to the following document: <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119431/Creating-End-User-Reporting-Applications/Web-Reporting/Using-Reporting-Controls-in-JS/Report-Designer-Integration-in-Angular2">Report Designer Integration in Angular2</a>.<br><br><strong>See also:<br></strong><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T566419">How to use the Web Document Viewer in JavaScript with Angular2</a>
