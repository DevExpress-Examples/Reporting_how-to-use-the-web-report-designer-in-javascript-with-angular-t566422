# How to use the Web Report Designer in JavaScript with Angular

The example consists of two parts: 

1. A server (backend) project in the ASP.NET MVC implementation, where cross-domain requests are enabled (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and custom report storage is implemented.

2. An <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> client application (frontend) that includes all the necessary styles, scripts, and HTML-templates. 

To download all the required client resources to deploy the control, navigate to the client part's root folder, open the console, and run the following command:

```npm install```

For the example to work correctly, first run a backend project in Visual Studio, and then use the command below to run the client part:

```ng serve```

Open your browser on <a href="http://localhost:4200/">http://localhost:4200/</a> to see the result.
